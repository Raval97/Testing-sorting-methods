# Testing-sorting-methods
Testing sorting methods Checking the efficiency of sorting methods for various types of tables with variable lengths


The project includes implementations of sorting methods:
- Bubble Sort
- Lomuto partition scheme in QuickSort
- Hore'a partition scheme in QuickSort
- Heap Sort
Counting all adjustments and comparisons is included for each method.

Types of tables:
- supplemented with random numbers
- completed with numbers sorted in ascending order
- supplemented with numbers sorted in descending order
- partialy sorted (10% of the elements are in the wrong position)


In order to generate random numbers, I used my own pseudo-random algorithm

The user has at his disposal a simple terminal interface in which he chooses a method sorting the type of table and its size

Finally, a txt file is created showing the collected data in the form of a table
